# Graph algorithms

## The following code contains:

- Breadth First Search (BFS) - O(n+m)
- Depth First Search (DFS) - O(n+m)
- Tarjan's Topological Sorting - O(n+m)
- Kahn's Topological Sorting - O(n+m)
- Kosaraju's Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju SCC) - O(n+m)
- Detect Cycle in Directed Graph - O(n+m)

// n - number of vertices, |V| = n
// m - number of edges, |E| = m
