# Graph algorithms

## The following code contains:

- Breadth First Search - BFS
- Depth First Search - DFS
- Tarjan's Topological Sorting
- Kahn's Topological Sorting
- Kosaraju's Strongly Connected Components - Kosaraju SCC
- Detect Cycle in Directed Graph - O(n+m)

// n - number of vertices
// m - number of edges
